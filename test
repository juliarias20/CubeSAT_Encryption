""" Pseudocode:
GOAL: to successfully encrypt a file that can be opened with a passcode.

1. create a file that can be encrypted
2. create an option to choose to encrypt the file. 
3. encrypt the file
4. choose to open the file with a passcode
5. choose passcode
6.set passcode to file

    After encrypting the file with a key, we will use this message to unlock  and lock the file back and forth.
    Potential research purposes include: using radio frequency to hack the process, UI system development
    Questions: can we transport this file from the pi to our ground station?
